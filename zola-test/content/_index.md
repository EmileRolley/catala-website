content = 'Implementations derived from legislative texts are hard to get right. The specification for how one quantity is computed may be scattered accross various places in your legislative source. Catala addressess this problem by interleaving the legislative source with the code that models it. To implement your program, just follow what the law says!'

title = '‚ôª One code, multiple execution targets'
subtitle = 'Simple code should be executed simply.'
content = 'Code derived from legislation generally uses basic programming concepts, that are present in every programming language. Why would you need a rules-engine or runtime environment to execute that code? Catala uses a fully-fledged compiler to bring you the code you need, in the programming language you need. That also include legacy environments used in large organizations.'

title = '‚öñ Validation from legal'
subtitle = 'Legislative code should be reviewed by legislative experts.'
content = 'For programs derived from legislation, validation relies on lawyers who generally write test cases by hand. Maintaining a large test base is costly in a context of fast-paced legislative reforms, as it is difficult to predict which tests will be affected by the changes. Catala is designed with law professionals to ensure that the code itself is reviewable by domain experts, increasing the level of assurance for no additional cost.'

subtitle = 'A programming language made by programming language specialists.'
content = 'Catala originates from <a href="https://www.inria.fr/fr">Inria</a>, the French National Institute for Computer Science Research. The language has been designed according to state-of-the-art programming languages design principles. Inspired from the ML language family, Catala features a unique default logic mechanism based on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3088206">the work of Sarah Lawsky</a>.'
